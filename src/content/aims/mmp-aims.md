aim1: Collect survey data from households in Mexican and Central American migrant places of origin and in U.S. places of destination to describe and analyze the determinants and consequences of U.S. migration, including the prevalence and dynamics of new forms of migration that include women, children and families.
aim2: Broaden migration research to embrace both threat-based and opportunity-based movements, and develop and test new theoretical approaches to migration that consider threats to well-being that stem from crime, violence, and climate and weather-related events.
