tag: LAMP
aim1: Collect survey data from households in Latin American migrant places of origin and in U.S. places of destination to describe and analyze the determinants and consequences of U.S. migration, including the prevalence and dynamics of new forms of migration that include women, children and families.
aim2: Broaden migration research to embrace both threat-based and opportunity-based movements, and develop and test new theoretical approaches to migration that consider threats to well-being that stem from crime, violence, and climate and weather-related events.
aim3: Make the data widely accessible to researchers in the U.S. and abroad for the study of Latin American migration to the United States.
