The MMP offers a series of documents to complement the MMP Database. The codebooks contain the list of variables and
coding scheme used in each individual file. The appendices provide further supplementary information such as year of
survey, state and place codes, etc. The questionnaires are the instruments developed and used by the MMP to gather its
data.
