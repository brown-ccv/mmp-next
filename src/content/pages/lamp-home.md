The Latin American Migration Project (LAMP) is a multidisciplinary research effort between investigators in various countries of Latin America and the United States. LAMP is currently based at Princeton University and the University of Guadalajara.

The LAMP was born as an extension of the Mexican Migration Project (MMP), which was created in 1982 by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to advance our understanding of the complex processes of international migration and immigration to the United States.

LAMP's purpose is to extend this research to migration flows originating in other Latin American countries. LAMP began operations in 1998 with a set of surveys conducted in Puerto Rico. It expanded later with fieldwork carried out in Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Haiti, Peru, and Guatemala. Ecuador is the most recent country in which we conducted fieldwork Spring 2012. In addition, a modified version of the LAMP survey was implemented in Paraguay to study migration from that country to Argentina.
