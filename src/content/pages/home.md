The Mexican Migration Project (MMP) was created in 1982 by an
interdisciplinary team of researchers to further our understanding of the
complex process of Mexican migration to the United States. The project is a
binational research effort co-directed by Jorge Durand, professor of Social
Anthropology at the University of Guadalajara (Mexico), and Douglas S. Massey,
professor of Sociology and Public Affairs, with a joint appointment in the
Woodrow Wilson School, at Princeton University (US).

Since its inception, the MMP's main focus has been to gather social as well as economic information on Mexican-US
migration. The data collected has been compiled in a comprehensive database that is available to the public free of
charge for research and educational purposes through this web-site.

The MMP is a unique source of data that enables researchers to track patterns and processes of contemporary Mexican
immigration to the United States. The project is a multi-disciplinary research effort that generates public use data on
the characteristics and behavior of Mexican migrants.
