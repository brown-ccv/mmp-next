The Mesoamerican Migration Project (MMP) is a continuation and expansion of the Mexican Migration Project which was created in 1982 by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to further our understanding of the complex process of Mexican migration to the United States. The Mesoamerican Migration Project collects and analyzes data on migration from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to the United States.  The project is a
binational research effort co-directed by David Lindstrom, professor of Sociology at Brown University, and Silvia Giorguli Saucedo and Jéssica Nájera Aguirre, professors of Demography at El Colegio de México.

The MMP's main focus is to gather social as well as economic information on Mexican and Central American migration to the United States. It is a unique source of data that enables researchers to track patterns and processes of migration, immigrant integration, and the consequences of migration for households and communities in places of origin. The data collected has been compiled in a comprehensive database that is available to the public free of charge for research and educational purposes through this web-site.
