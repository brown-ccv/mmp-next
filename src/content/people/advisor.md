bio: Lindstrom's research examines the determinants and consequences of migration in economically developing societies, the transition into adulthood, and the changing dynamics of reproductive health and behavior. In Mexico and Guatemala, Lindstrom studies the interrelationship between migration and stages of the family life cycle, and the role of migration in the diffusion of urban reproductive norms and behavior back to rural places of origin. In Ethiopia, he examines the social and demographic determinants of fertility, and the influence of the social and cultural context on early life course transitions. Lindstrom teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on statistics, population and development, migration, and adolescent transitions into adulthood.
