bio: Fernando Riosmena is Professor of Sociology and Demography and Director of
  the Institute for Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas – San
  Antonio. His research interests span two main areas. First, Riosmena’s work
  aims at improving understanding of the theories, drivers, empirical
  measurement, and analytical strategies to analyze migration, with a particular
  focus on the social, economic, environmental, and policy factors likely
  influencing international movement between Mesoamerica and the United States
  using a cross-context comparative perspective. Second, Riosmena’s research
  examines the health, aging, and wellbeing of immigrants, comparing migrant
  trajectories in these domains with those of nonmigrant counterfactual
  experiences in sending areas and destinations to assess the likely impacts of
  migration, the immigrant adaptation process, and the processes driving
  race-ethnic disparities.
