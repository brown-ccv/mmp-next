Presentation on Smuggler Fees

Lindstrom gave a talk at the Yale University Center for Empirical Research on Stratification and Inequality on undocumented Mexican border crossings and smuggler fees. Using data from the MMP and the Survey of Migration at the Northern Border of Mexico (EMIF), Lindstrom developed preliminary estimates of the annual number of undocumented Mexican migrants entering the U.S. from 1980 to 2008. Based on the estimated number of undocumented migrants and estimates of smuggler fees from the two surveys, Lindstrom developed estimates of the total amount spent on smugglers in each year. Lindstrom, MMP consultant Katharine Donato and Marie-Laure Coubes, Director of EMIF, will present a paper at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America in Washington, D.C. on the number of undocumented Mexican migrants entering the U.S. each year from 1980 to 2020.
