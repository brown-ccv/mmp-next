#### MMP-LAMP Presentations and Training

The Ethnosurvey of Recent Immigration in Latin American Destinations (Etnoencuesta de Inmigracion Reciente en Contextos de Acogida Latinoamericanas - LAMP-ENIR 2021) used the MMP style migrant destination questionnaire and study design to survey Venezuelan immigrants in Barranquilla, Cúcuta and Santa Marta, Colombia; Venezuelan and Nicaraguan immigrants in San Jose, Costa Rica; and Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants in Santiago de Chile. Respondents were recruited for interviews using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to collecting retrospective migration and life history data, the questionnaires collected information on integration experiences in the destinations, including housing, employment, schooling, health and food insecurity. Data from the study can be accessed at the LAMP-ENIR website at El Colegio de México (<https://mmp-lamp.colmex.mx/etnoencuesta/>). MMP-LAMP co-directors were invited to the Universidad Militar Nueva Granda, Bogotá, Colombia to discuss potential collaborations on migration studies and to present results from the LAMP-ENIR 2021 survey. Lindstrom also conducted a workshop on the use of the MMP-LAMP-ENIR data bases for students and researchers at the University.
